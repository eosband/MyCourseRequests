# MyCourseRequests

**About**

MyCourseRequests is a full stack application created with Swift and Django as a final project for *CSC630: Full Stack Development* at Phillips Academy Andover. Created in collaboration with Chris Ward. Its purpose is to streamline the rudimentary course request system at Andover. Users can create accounts, login, and put together their class schedule with helpful tips and autocompletes to maximize user efficiency and ease.
